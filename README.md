# MNIST Digit Recognition with Flask

This project is a web-based application that allows users to predict handwritten digits using a pre-trained machine learning model on the MNIST dataset. The app also supports the ability to upload custom CSV files containing image data for predictions.

## Features

- *MNIST Dataset Prediction*: Automatically uses the pre-trained MNIST model to predict a digit from the MNIST test dataset.
- *Custom CSV Upload*: Users can upload CSV files containing 28x28 pixel data (flattened images) to predict digits.
- *Accuracy and Loss Chart*: Displays a prediction result alongside a chart that shows the accuracy and loss of the model during training.
- *Predicted Digit Display*: Shows the predicted digit image alongside the chart for better visualization.

## Tech Stack

- *Flask*: Python web framework for creating the app.
- *TensorFlow/Keras*: For loading the pre-trained MNIST model and making predictions.
- *Matplotlib*: Used for generating the accuracy/loss chart.
- *Pandas*: For reading CSV files uploaded by users.
- *Bootstrap*: For styling the web pages.

├── models/               # Directory containing the pre-trained MNIST model file

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-recognition.git
cd mnist-digit-recognition
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

Install the necessary Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Pre-trained Model:

Download the pre-trained model mnist_model.h5 and place it in the models/ directory. If you don't have this file, you can train the model using the MNIST dataset or download a pre-trained model from various sources.
Run the Flask application:

To start the application, run:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the app:

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the application.

Features Explained
Home Page (index.html):

The home page allows users to choose between using the MNIST dataset or uploading a custom CSV file.
MNIST Dataset Prediction:

The app will use the pre-trained model to predict a digit from a random sample from the MNIST test dataset.
The result includes the predicted digit, an accuracy/loss chart, and the predicted digit's image.
CSV Upload (upload.html):

Users can upload a CSV file that contains flattened 28x28 pixel data for digit recognition. Each row should represent one digit image with 784 columns (28x28 pixels).
After uploading the file, the app will make predictions on the images and display the results.
Result Page (result.html):

Displays the predicted digit, the accuracy and loss chart, and the predicted digit snippet as an image.
Example CSV Format
The CSV file should have rows where each row represents a flattened 28x28 pixel image of a digit. The CSV should look like this:

Pixel1	Pixel2	Pixel3	...	Pixel784
0	0	0	...	0
0	0	0	...	0
...	...	...	...	...
You can generate a CSV file by flattening 28x28 images into a single row of 784 pixels.
